SERVER_PORT=10080


### the port for our secure, TLS 1.3 server

SSL_SERVER_PORT=10443


### the name of our host on the internet.  Used by our
### system when it needs to build a self-referencing URL.

### The log levels are:
###
### Related to the business purposes of the application.  That is,
### the very highest-level, perhaps least-common logging messages.
### AUDIT
###
### Information useful for debugging.
### DEBUG
###
###
### Represents an error that occurs in a separate thread, so
### that we are not able to catch it bubbling up
### ASYNC_ERROR
###
###
### Information marked as trace is pretty much entered for
### the same reason as DEBUG - i.e. so we can see important
### information about the running state of the program. The
### only difference is that trace information is very voluminous.
### That is, there's tons of it, and it could make it harder
### to find the important information amongst a lot of noise.
### For that reason, TRACE is usually turned off.
### TRACE
###
### list them here, separated by commas
#LOG_LEVELS=DEBUG,TRACE,ASYNC_ERROR,AUDIT

LOG_LEVELS=DEBUG,ASYNC_ERROR,AUDIT

### TheBrig (TheBrig.java) manages a collection of identifiers
### for attackers of our system.  Disabling it here will cause it
### to abdicate its job - mainly for testing purposes - probably
### performance testing.
IS_THE_BRIG_ENABLED=true

### This property lets the user add mappings between file suffixes
### and mime types.  For example, "png" to "image/png" or whatever.
### See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types
###
### Try to follow the syntax here - be careful - the syntax is fragile. It
### goes like this: key,value,key,value,... but a backslash at the end of
### a line lets us break into multiple lines
EXTRA_MIME_MAPPINGS=\
png,image/png,\
wav,audio/wav,\
woff2,font/woff2,\
ico,image/png,\
svg,image/svg+xml

### These are error messages that arrive to the server code
### when an unusual request arrives, potentially signifying an attack.
### Do note that several of these are likely to show up if you
### are running testing tools against the app.
### also, understand that while our code may interpret
### a request as an attack, nothing else will happen unless TheBrig
### is enabled, in which case the offender will be added to a list
### and denied connection.

### Mainly modified for testing purposes.  Be careful.  See minum.Constants


### This describes the maximum length of bytes, total, Minum will read from a body.
### By default, set to 10 megabytes.  Be aware that there is some subtlety here.  The
### system will parse the data as it pulls from the socket.  If your system is expected
### to handle large data uploads, it would be worthwhile to investigate the code in
### places like BodyProcessor.extractBodyFromBytes
###
### If a request exceeds this value, the ip address of that client will be barred from the
### system for the length of time in VULN_SEEKING_JAIL_DURATION, and each additional request
### during that time will extend the duration similarly.

#MAX_READ_SIZE_BYTES=10485760

### The maximum bytes allowed for a single line when the server is reading by line. This
### will affect the headers, including the request and status lines.  It may be necessary
### to increase this value if your server requires larger headers, such as when using
### JWT's for authentication.
###
### If a request exceeds this value, the ip address of that client will be barred from the
### system for the length of time in VULN_SEEKING_JAIL_DURATION, and each additional request
### during that time will extend the duration similarly.

#MAX_READ_LINE_SIZE_BYTES=1024

### How long we will wait before closing a connection, if we are
### on a keep-alive connection.  The default value is probably fine
### in most cases.

#KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=3


### A timeout, in milliseconds, for TCP sockets. If this value
### is a positive integer, the socket will block for that length
### of time.  If zero, it is interpreted as an infinite timeout
### This is a good option to consider if you are doing debugging -
### it is much easier to debug without a timeout interrupting
### your work.  That is to say, this might be set to zero for
### local debugging, and cleared or set to some positive value
### for production.

#SOCKET_TIMEOUT_MILLIS=30000


### Length of time, in milliseconds, bad actors will be prevented
### from connecting.

#VULN_SEEKING_JAIL_DURATION=10000


### Here is another option you might adjust to improve local
### debugging and feature development.  The default is true,
### because it has nice performance to use a cache for all
### static files.  But, if you set this to false in local
### development, it will not cache anything, meaning that
### every adjustment to a static file (e.g. css, js files)
### will be immediately sent from the server.  Of course, you
### still need to consider any potential caching on the browser.

#USE_CACHE_FOR_STATIC_FILES=true


### This defines how many static files we will store in a LRU
### cache in our program.  This means all static files like
### css or js files, and static images, will get stored in this
### cache, up to a maximum count as set here.  This is a bit
### of a function of how many static files you expect to have
### in combination with how large those files are.  The more
### in the cache, the more memory it takes.  In many cases,
### there should not be too much concern, but here is a dial
### for it, just in case.

#MAX_ELEMENTS_LRU_CACHE_STATIC_FILES=1000
